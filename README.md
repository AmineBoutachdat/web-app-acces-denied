# Goal
This website will be selling used cars. Unlike any other car buying website we are targeting our customer first. Instead of letting the customer getting lost in a list of choices, this website helps the customer to find the perfect car for him. Are you looking for your first car to learn how to drive? Or maybe you have a large family and need some more space? Our website shows what is best for you. We also keep the users search data stored so we can optimize our customers interests with A.I.. 

Also, before selling a car on our store there are a few requirements needed before you can sell it. We do not want customers to worry anymore about the vehicle inspection, not enough images,... . So we will keep things in check from our side.

Maybe you don't need or want to sell an entire car. At our website you can also sell or buy car pieces separated without having to buy an entire car to keep everyone satisfied.
